# Rail-fence-and-Row-Transposition Ciphers

A modern, responsive web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using two classical cryptographic techniques:
- **Rail Fence Cipher**  
- **Row Transposition Cipher**

Users can input messages, select a key, and see encrypted and decrypted outputs instantly via a visually styled and animated web interface.
